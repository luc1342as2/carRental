Car Rental Application
I created this Car Rental Application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate the process of reserving a rental vehicle. 
Hereâ€™s what I focused on:
Customizable Rentals: Users can select car types, rental duration, and view real-time pricing updates based on their choices.
Dynamic Data Processing: JavaScript handles data updates, rental summaries, and cost calculations, ensuring accuracy and a smooth experience.
User-Friendly Design: I designed an intuitive, responsive interface with HTML and CSS, making the application easy to navigate across devices.
Skill Showcase: This project demonstrates my ability to create business-oriented applications using JavaScript, with an emphasis on interactivity and an optimized user experience.
